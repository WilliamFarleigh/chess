# Text Based Chess
This is a Python 3 chess program with textual input and output.

Two versions planned. One version that uses more of the fundamentals, and one version that uses more complicated features like classes and methods. 
Inputting moves is done by putting in two spaces:
The format is "letter + number", where letters represent columns and numbers represent rows.  
Eg:  
e2e4  

Eventually planning to add commands.
Eg:
/help
/captured
/whose_move
/flip_board
etc.
